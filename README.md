# 📊 SaaS FinTech Revenue Funnel Analysis

Welcome to the Revenue Funnel Analysis project for a SaaS FinTech product!  
This project dives deep into the product funnel, using SQL, Python, and data visualization techniques to identify drop-off points and suggest actionable improvements to boost revenue.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

The goal is to identify where users are falling off in the order funnel and simulate potential revenue gains by improving interaction and login completion rates.

## 🧪 Tech Stack Used

- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, cleaning
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and reporting
- **Streamlit** *(optional)*: For deployment as a web app

## 📊 Funnel Overview

| Stage               | Users |
|---------------------|--------|
| Started             | 3055   |
| Interacted          | 1380   |
| Login Attempted     | 1053   |
| Login Completed     | 320    |
| Order Completed     | 351    |

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Almost **50%** of users drop off before interaction.
- Less than **25%** successfully complete login.
- **1% increase** in user interaction can yield **$285/day**
- **1% increase** in login completion can yield **$405/day**

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. Add reminder emails/texts to inactive users.
2. Improve workflow copy (mention duration, use progress bar).
3. Guide users at the bank login stage.
4. Empower client teams (like mortgage lenders) to assist users.
